# Stock_Prediction
For one of my assignments for CS-677 I used pandas to make predictions about a chosen stock and compared it to the S & P 500. For each stock I created a funciton that predicted the future stock prices based on different patterns of data in the past. 

The packages that I used for this homework is pandas and matploitlib.
