# Stock_Prediction 

For one of my assignments for CS-677 I used pandas to make predictions about Zynga and compared it to the S & P 500. For both Zynga(ZNGA) and S&P 500 I created a function that predicted the future stock prices based on different patterns of data in the past. Another part of the assignment is that I took the increase in return in the first three years to predict the results in the next two years. The last part is taking a real life example of investing money into the stock market to see which strategy would be best to generate the highest profit. 

The packages that I used for this homework is pandas and matploitlib.
